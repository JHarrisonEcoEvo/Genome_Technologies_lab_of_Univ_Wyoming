This repository holds some of the data and scripts used for Harrison et al. "Characterizing microbiomes via sequencing of marker loci: techniques to improve throughput, account for cross-contamination, and reduce cost"

We provide example sequencing data created using our one-step PCR library preparation procedure here:\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.15786/20.500.11919/7186}. These data were generated by the iSeq platform and contain 16S and ITS sequences from snow collected by Abigail Hoffman. At this same URL, we also have provided iSeq data of a library containing only coligos, mock community, and internal standard (at varying concentrations). This library was created using our two-step PCR procedure.

Example NovaSeq data generated using our two-step library preparation procedure can be found at: \url{https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11919/7166}.

Repository contents:

16Smergedstats.csv - this combines statistics for how many reads were present in each replicate and how many passed merging and filtering. This was for the 16S NovaSeq data. 

ITSmergedstats.csv - see previous, but for ITS.

NovaSeq2_DemuxJH.csv - sample to well key for Novaseq run

Oligos_1step... - Excel file showing oligo sequences. 

ProportionFig.R - script to make panels d and e in Fig. 2

coligoFigure-1.afdesign - Affinity Designer file for the figure.

coligos16sITS.csv - coligo sequences

coligoTable_novaseq2 - coligo read count table from complex Novaseq run involving samples from many different working groups

coligoTable_testRun_iseq10 - table linking coligo sequences to replicates. ABC refer to the three replicates for each coligo. These data only include coligo, ISD (referred to as SG in the table), and mock community (MC).


modifiedColigoChecker.R - script to determine prevalence of coligos among samples

parse_count.pl - demultiplexing script
